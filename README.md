<h3 align="center"> ✍🏿 About Me... </h3>

I started my journey thanks to my brother in 2011, he saw I loved to design and to create worlds so he showed me the pathway to game development with pseudo-code. That quickly sparked a passion for technology. I explored the pathway further by learning C# by renting a book from the local library. This interest in programming expanded into general software development and writing .NET applications, taking my design principles to build and design UI and websites!
 
 🎮 Currently working on [Restitched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R7e1X8UE7k "Watch the reveal trailer") as a passion project in Unity3D. 

 🏢 Currently hired as a Software Developer at Atlanticus Holdings in Atlanta.

 🍎 Beginner mindset, always looking to learn!
 
 🏫 Working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science (2nd year!)
 
 💭 Uniquely imaginative and independent
 
 👑 Ask me about: Art and software development
 
 ⌨️ Tools of the trade: `Java`, `C#`, `React`, `SQL`, `Python`, and `JavaScript`
 
 ⚡ Fun fact: I considered pursuing a degree in Culinary Arts due to my love for cooking food. My favorite food is griot (Haitian Fried Pork)!
